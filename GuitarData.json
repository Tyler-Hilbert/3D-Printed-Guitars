I also added pegs / holes in the joints to give the body some additional mechanical strength in addition to the glue. The naming convention for the files is this: Each main body piece has a number, 1 through 9, as well as a brief description of what each piece is. Each peg has a pair of numbers to indicate which pieces it connects, as well as a description if there are multiple pegs connecting the same pieces. Edit: 16 July 2021 I have seen comments that 'mid-upper.stl' is corrupted. It looks fine on my end, but if you see the same, try 'mid-upper-reuploaded.stl'",

Parameters were set to optimize stiffness in the pulling direction of the strings as well as to guarrantee it will not snap if you use it with a strap. As opposed to the strat I also designed I actually finished this build and played it! It works great!  You can check the strat here: https://www.printables.com/model/446798-shape-optimized-squier-strat The body was printed in three pieces on my custom delta printer. The pieces were then glued together with high quality epoxy and two M8 threaded rods. 8mm holes are already in place to help alignment. The print will most likely come out a bit rough. You can smooth it with some filler and sand paper. There's no electronics cover since I never designed it. Holes for routing the wires are already in place but you'll need to reopen them with a long drill bit. Hardware: I picked the cheapest bridge I could find on Amazon. I'ts kept in place via 5 wood screws. As for the neck I again went with the cheapest P bass neck I could find online. For pickups I used Seymour Duncan SPB-3 quarter pound, but any P style pickups will work. There's place for two pots, one for volume and one for tone. The output jack is a \u00bc barrel style connector. Again I went with the cheapest I could find. If I remember correctly the neck pocket was too deep so I included some printed shims to raise it. It was my first build so don't judge me! Hope you like it!",

        "description": "The Model M Guitar was a personal research project in seeking the feasibility of building the first acoustic guitar totally printed in 3D with almost no support material. The design was inspired by Devin Montes' The Bodysnatcher design, an Australian Youtuber, to make the acoustic body of the guitar independent of the arm, what makes the design modular and allow you to create your own body. The Project was accomplished through the support of MakerLab FACAMP that made available the space and 3D filament for the construction of this project. I would like to thank the support and enthusiasm of my friends Ana Beatriz Linardi and Rafael Coelho who believed and helped in this project.",
